Installation notes for fd2python.

1. Modify Makefile and change the following appropriately:

        INSTALL_ROOT    = /home/jmerritt/gnu
        X11_ROOT        = /usr/X11R6
        FORMS_ROOT      = /usr/X11R6
        PATH_TO_FDESIGN = $(X11_ROOT)/bin/fdesign

2. make

   All this does is copy fd2python and forms.i to the install
   include directory.
